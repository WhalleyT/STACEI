# STACEI
STACEI: STructural Analysis of TCR-pEptide-MHC Interactions

STACEI is a tool, primarily written in Python and R designed for the analysis and exploration of T-cell receptor (TCR) to peptide:major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) crystal structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

STACEI leverages several pre-existing tools for its analyses. As such, the following must already be installed before using it:

* [CCP4 suite](http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/)

* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

* [PyMol](https://www.schrodinger.com/suites/pymol)
